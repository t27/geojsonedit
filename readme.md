#Geojsonedit

A geojson file  viewer and editor. This tool lets you load multiple geojson file and view them on a map. Also you can view the corresponding geojson of the files individually and collectively.

In terms of editing functionality, it is possible to edit the geometry and JSON properties of the loaded layers. It is possible to select an active layer and then add,remove or edit existing features on it.

The tool uses [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) for map and geojson display. It uses the [Leaflet-Draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw) plugin for the feature drawing and editing capability. The initial inspiration for this cam from Geojson.io and the property editor is a derivative from it.

hope it helps you!
